  "paragraph":"NX 2400 16 Transistor Board NX-2400 is a 16 tranjist board that looks like a circuit of many powerful as well. We only make a circuit manifest and we check before reaching your hands. The circuit we create using the fiber board and it has the Hit Registory Soldier Masking, which makes the board safe copper from the outside humidity. The air can control your Amplifier Board's Basing Control by trimming by air. If there is a good quality transist then 900 ml will be able to keep 1.2 volts DC volt from Voelt. And if Transistor is a little normal quality then you can take 700 ml of volts. You can set your Circuit's output DC volt through the teprampat vio. Remember that Volt T is kept near Zero but must keep 10 ml down the volt",
